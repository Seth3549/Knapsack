My first attempt to use GitHub !!!!

I would like to understand the process by which others are sharing and assisting codes for improvements.

Here is a Python code of one implementation of the Branch and Bound technique to solve the Knapsack problem.

The algorithm works but reasonably sure that it does not always find the Global optimum.

As a first pass, i would like to learn from others, if I can implement exactly the same algorithm, as coded by me, any better.

Also attaching the original paper and the test data that was used in the paper.
